**Student Survey Form**<br><br>

A beginner self-project where I apply my skills to create a simple survey form that asks<br> 
the student details about themselves, such as name and interests. When submitting, the<br>
page does not save the inputted data and follows a link to the Google search engine<br>
homepage. <br><br>

**Tools Used**<br>
SCode IDE (Version 1.67.2)
